### Introduction to CyberShield 🛡️

We created **CyberShield** because we kept seeing cyberbullying everywhere—on Discord, Instagram, and even inside our school’s group chats. 
There isn’t a lot of support for cyberbullying, and victims are often left without someone to talk to, or wondering if they’re overthinking things and aren’t actually being cyberbullied.

### 🧠 How We Built It

When we were brainstorming ideas, we first tried a cyberbullying detector—and we liked it a lot. 
After setting up the AI website, we split up and each worked on an individual part of the project. 
Once the AIs were complete, we finalized the overall look of the website.
